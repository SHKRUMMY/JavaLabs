You need to create a class - Manager that will contain logic (example for option 1):
Realize the search for goods that can be bought for a girl in the autumn period and realize the possibility of sorting the found goods:
at a price
by size
The implementation of sorting should provide the ability to sort both in descending and ascending order



Use the built-in sorting methods available in Java to sort
Sorting should be implemented in a separate method
The code does not contain static methods / attributes. Only one static method is allowed - void
Code must use enum type (if necessary)
